merge with trunk
----------------

http://plone.org/products/autocompletewidget/issues/3

this branch should be merged with trunk - if that's possible at all.

this branch was based on a copy of rev 7183 of MoreFieldsAndWidgets/AutocompleteWidget/branches/displaylist_support


list of all changes made on trunk (before it has been eggiefied)
http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/log/MoreFieldsAndWidgets/AutocompleteWidget/trunk?rev=12137


merge GS Support and Safari fixes
---------------------------------

if merging it completely is not possible (since changeset 9371 is fairly extensive),
we should at least merge the most useful changes such as GS support (9373) or the safari fixes (9672)


other todos
-----------

* submit form or trigger a custom function on enter key press when menu is hidden
* replace the javascript factory with the latest version from the original author
* use a div with scrollbar instead of a table and some
  obscure way of dealing with scrolling
